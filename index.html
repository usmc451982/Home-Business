		<h2>About CJ</h2>
		<p>Hi!  My name is Courtney and I'm a Marine veteran and IT Pro.  I spent 12 years on active duty with three combat tours under my belt.  After leaving the Corps, I did a few jobs here and there but nothing that I was passionate about.  I've always had a love for computers and technology so it only made sense to get back to doing something that I love.  I went to school at MyComputerCareer in Houston, Tx where I learned new skills to get into the IT industry.  My ultimate goal is CyberSecurity and I'm working why way to that but in the meantime, I would love to help you with your computer needs!</p>
